# Winter 2023 -- To-Do List with React.js

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Created by following the [MDN WebDocs Tutorial on React](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_todo_list_beginning).

In Progress:
- [ ] componentizing the code (see pg. 2 of tutorial)
- [ ] events & states (pg.3 --> actually get program to work)
- [ ] editing & filtering (pg. 4)

Ideas Phase:
- [ ] assign task to people & filter list based on owner of task
- [ ] quick tasks
- [ ] due dates on tasks
- [ ] repeating tasks (e.g. daily)
